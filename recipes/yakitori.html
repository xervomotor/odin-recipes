        Yakitori (焼き鳥) are grilled chicken skewers made from bite sized
        pieces of meat from all different parts of the chicken, such as the
        breasts, thighs, skin, liver and other innards. Usually made to order
        and cooked over charcoal, yakitori is a popular, inexpensive dish
        commonly enjoyed together with a glass of beer.

      <h1>Steps</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Use chicken thigh and cut chicken thigh into even sized strips as much
          as possible. So that the chicken cooks through evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Soak the bamboo skewers in water for 20 minutes beforehand. This is
          important and prevents the skewers from burning. Presentation is
          important, we don’t want to see burnt skewers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Skewer Chicken tightly leaving no gap between (that’s why cut chicken
          into strips)
        </li>
        <li>
          When the chicken is roughly 80% cooked, start brushing with the sauce.
          The sauce will easily burn otherwise. This is because it contains
          sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not move around the skewers, wait until one side is browned, then
          turn over and cook the other side.
        </li>
